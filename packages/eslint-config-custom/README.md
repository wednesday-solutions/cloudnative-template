# Eslint Common Configuration

Common ESLint configuration for the project reside here! These can be extended by any of the application and the configs can be overwritten by the applications themselves. Its still recommended to follow what config we have here since its quite compliant with standards.

Also note that we're not using Prettier we rely on ESLint to format and provide references about indentations.
