# Debugging

This directory does not directly relate to anything in the projects but rather contains files and configurations for debugging in various IDEs. For now we've few IDEs that we personally use and have got configurations for. We welcome any contributions related to configurations for various IDEs if you use one!

## VSCode

The configurations for VSCode goes into the `.vscode` directory at your root project. The default name should be `launch.json` and should be used. A better idea would be to look into how VSCode debugger works! [Debugger in VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/debugging)
