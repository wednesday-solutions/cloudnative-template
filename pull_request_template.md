## How to Test

<!--

A straightforward scenario of how to test your changes could help colleagues that are not familiar with the part of the code that you are changing but want to see it in action. This section can include a description or step-by-step instructions of how to get to the state of v2 that your change affects.

A "How To Test" section can look something like this:

- Sign in with a user with tracks
- Activate `show_awesome_cat_gifs` feature (add `?feature.show_awesome_cat_gifs=1` to your URL)
- You should see a GIF with cats dancing
